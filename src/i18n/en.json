    "challenge": "For the NFT upgrade, the smart contract needed to get information about the user's spent gas",
    "solution": "We solved this problem using Pancakeswap. During the smart contract sale, the nft accesses Pancakeswap and asks for liquidity for the BUSD-BNB pair and calculates how much the BNB is worth in dollars. Then, it goes back to Pancakeswap and asks for liquidity for the BNB-ProjectToken pair and calculates how much the project token is worth in BNB."
